# About Me
I'm **Jiacong Fang**(方嘉聪 in Chinese), a third-year undergraduate majoring in Computer Science in Yuanpei College, Peking University. 
And I'm a member of the Turing Class in the department of EECS, Peking University.

I'm now a undergraduate intern in the [CameraLab](https://camera.pku.edu.cn) of Peking University, supervised by Prof. [Boxin Shi](https://ci.idm.pku.edu.cn). Currently, I'm mentored by [Chengxuan Zhu](https://freebutuselesssoul.github.io) in the lab as well.

My research interest lies in computational photography and computer vision. Feel free to contact me if you have any questions or ideas to discuss.

In my spare time, I enjoy playing billiards and running. Cute cats are always my favorite.
