# About Me
My name is **Jiacong Fang**(方嘉聪 in Chinese), a final-year undergraduate majoring in Computer Science in Yuanpei College, Peking University and  a member of the [Turing Class](https://cfcs.pku.edu.cn/english/research/turing_program/introduction1/index.htm) in the department of EECS, Peking University.

I am expected to graduate in July 2026 and will pursue a PhD degree in the School of Computer Science at Peking University starting September 2026, under the supervision of  Prof. [Boxin Shi](https://camera.pku.edu.cn). Currently, I am also mentored by [Chengxuan Zhu](https://freebutuselesssoul.github.io) and [Shuchen Weng](https://shuchenweng.github.io).

My research interests lie in computer vision and computational photography. Recently, I am exploring the application of AIGC in aesthetic and photographic image editing, with the aim of enhancing both visual realism and editing precision. Feel free to contact me if you have any questions or ideas to discuss.

In my spare time, I enjoy playing billiards and running. Cute cats are always my favorite.
